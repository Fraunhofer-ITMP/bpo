  <i>Bioassay Protocol Ontology (BPO)</i>
  <br>
</h1>

<p align="center">
An application ontology for extending interoperability for <i>in-vivo</i> bioassay protocols relevant to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) drug discovery.
</p>


## Why do we need it?
To enhance the reproducibility and usability of bioassays in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) associated antibacterial drug discovery and development, there is an increasing need for standardisation of bioassay metadata into machine-readable formats. Such a standardisation process requires mapping bioassay data to standard ontologies and can be performed at the study result output and protocol levels. At the result output level, general ontologies such as the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) already exist, but antibacterial drug discovery and AMR-specific ontologies that can aid in the standardisation process at the protocol level are missing. 

**Hence, we propose an application-specific ontology that will enable researchers to convert unstructured bioassay protocol data into structured machine-readable formats thereby promoting their overall reusability**.

The development of BPO is a first attempt to standardise and organise information within in-vivo AMR-related drug discovery bioassay protocol data in a structured manner. BPO will allow researchers to capture information regarding experimental details such as the type of mouse model, the bacterial strain, and the sex and growth phases of mouse and bacteria respectively from the protocol.

## Building tools

The [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/) tool was used to build this ontology and the structure of the ontology was formulated based on the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit)

## Versioning and Formats

The ontology is available in [Ontology Web Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/) format.

The **current version of the ontology is 0.0.1** and can be found [here](bpo_0.0.1.owl). 

BPO has 202 classes and 2,547 axioms and follows the BFO top-level ontology tree.

## Ontology Overview

Since the current ontology is an application ontology, it makes use of various existing ontologies for its purpose. The ontologies used, and the number of terms extracted from them are shown below:

| Ontology Name | Ontology abbreviation | Number of terms | BFO compliant |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| NCBI taxonomy database| NCBITaxon | 120 | No |
| Phenotype And Trait Ontology | PATO | 7 | Yes |
| National Cancer Institute Thesaurus | NCIt | 13 | No |
| Vaccine Ontology | VO | 1 | No |
| Ontology for Biomedical Investigations | OBI | 4 | Yes |
| Ontology for MIRNA Target | OMIT | 1 | Yes |
| Microbial Conditions Ontology | MCO | 3 | Yes |
| Infectious Disease Ontology | IDO | 3 | Yes |
| Experimental Factor Ontology | EFO | 7 | Yes |
| *Bioassay Protocol Ontology* | BPO | 32 | Yes |

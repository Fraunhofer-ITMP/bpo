https://github.com/Fraunhofer-ITMP/BPO_00030	1A8-based immunosupression	antibody-based immunosuppression	InVivoMAb anti-mouse Ly6G, anti-mouse Ly6G	The 1A8 monoclonal antibody reacts with mouse Ly6G. Ly6G is a 21-25 kDa member of the Ly-6 superfamily of GPI-anchored cell surface proteins with roles in cell signaling and cell adhesion. Ly6G is expressed differentially during development by cells in the myeloid lineage including monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and neutrophils. Monocytes typically express Ly6G transiently during development while mature granulocytes and peripheral neutrophils retain expression making Ly6G a good cell surface marker for these populations. Unlike the RB6-8C5 antibody, the 1A8 antibody reacts specifically with mouse Ly6G with no reported cross reactivity with Ly6C.

The antibody is reported to react strongly with mouse Ly6G and Ly6C previously referred to as GR-1. Ly6G is a 21-25 kDa member of the Ly-6 superfamily of GPI-anchored cell surface proteins with roles in cell signaling and cell adhesion. Ly6G is expressed differentially during development by cells in the myeloid lineage including monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and neutrophils. Monocytes typically express Ly6G transiently during development while mature granulocytes and peripheral neutrophils retain expression making Ly6G a good cell surface marker for these populations. Ly6C is a monocyte/macrophage and endothelial cell differentiation antigen regulated by interferon gamma and is thought to play a role in the development and maturation of lymphocytes. The NIMP-R14 antibody has been shown to be useful for depletion of neutrophils in mice.

Ly6G is a 21-25 kDa member of the Ly-6 superfamily of GPI-anchored cell surface proteins with roles in cell signaling and cell adhesion. Ly6G is expressed differentially during development by cells in the myeloid lineage including monocytes macrophages granulocytes and neutrophils. Monocytes typically express Ly6G transiently during development while mature granulocytes and peripheral neutrophils retain expression making Ly6G a good cell surface marker for these populations.The RB6-8C5 antibody has been shown to inhibit the binding of the 1A8 antibody. The 1A8 monoclonal antibody reacts specifically with mouse Ly6G with no reported cross reactivity with Ly6C.

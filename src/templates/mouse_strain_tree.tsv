https://github.com/Fraunhofer-ITMP/BPO_00006	outbred mouse strain	mouse strain by genetic background	outbred mice	An outbred strain is a colony of laboratory mouse within which there is some genetic variation, which has been closed for at least four generations. It is usually maintained to minimise inbreeding, which should not normally exceed onepercent per generation. This can be achieved with random mating using at least 25 breeding pairs per generation. A breeding scheme which ensuresthat each breeding male is represented by one male, and each breeding female is represented by one female in the next generation can halvethese number. Usually this is achieved using a rotational breedingscheme. However, most commercial colonies are maintained with hundredsor even thousands of breeding animals where genetic drift due toinbreeding is likely to be minimal, but the stock characteristics maychange as a result of selective breeding (e.g. for fast growth rate) orgenetic contamination (i.e. getting two stocks mixed).

https://github.com/Fraunhofer-ITMP/BPO_00011	C3H/HeN	inbred mouse strain	C3Hf/HeN	C3H/HeN mice are used in a wide range of studies. They are homozygous for the Pde6brd1 allele and have an early onset severe retinal degeneration that causes blindness at weaning age. Despite an atherogenic diet, C3H/HeN mice do not develop aortic atherosclerosis, in contrast to the C57BL/6J. There is a genetically mediated difference between the C3H/HeN and the C3H/HeJ regarding their response to bacterial endotoxin (LPS). This response is linked to the TL4 protein (Toll-like receptor 4; previously lps). C3H/HeN are Tlr4lps-n (toll-like receptor 4; normal LPS response), previously LPSn. This strain will have a normal response to an LPS challenge, it is said to be endotoxin-sensitive.

This colony was introduced from Germany in the 1910s and 1920s and established as a strain at the National Institute of Health (Yoken, presently, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases). The strain name ddY stands for Deutschland, Denken, and Yoken. The ddY strain differs from the DDY strain because the DDY strain has been established as an inbred strain from the ddY colony at Yoken (note that the inbred strain DDY is spelled with all uppercase letters and with lowercase letters in the name of outbred strain ddY).
